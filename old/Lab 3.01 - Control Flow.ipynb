    "1. We set a condition using the **\"if\"** statement\n",
    "2. After **\"if\"**, we put a **boolean expression**\n",
    "3. We end the statement with a **semi-colon - :**\n",
    "4. We start a **new line with an indentation**\n",
    "5. On the new line, we write **the code that should execute if our boolean is True**\n",
    "6. Below, we put an **\"else\" statement**, in line with the \"if\" statement\n",
    "7. On a new, indented line, we write the code that should execute **if our boolean is False**\n",
